## Google Cloud Platform

### Elasticity

Don't create large clusters of machines which lie redundant - rather, use maximum processing capabilities for the minimum duration, then shut them down.

### GCP Big Data Products

No-ops - no systems operation required. You just have jobs which you submit to the cloud, Google Cloud figures out which machines to run it on.

### A functional view

- Foundation: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage.
- Databases: Cloud Datastore, Cloud SQL, Cloud Bigtable.
	- Change where you compute.
- Analytics and ML: BigQuery, Cloud Datalab, Translate API...
	- Change how you compute.
- Data handling frameworks: Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataproc.
	- Scalability, reliability

Example use case: [Rooms to Go](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/rooms-to-go-improves-the-shopper-experience/)

- Spend less on ops / admin
- Real-time data into apps & architectures
- Apply machine learning broadly & easily
- Create citizen data scientists
